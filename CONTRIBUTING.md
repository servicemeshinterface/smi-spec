## CLA Requirement

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require
you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have
the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For
details, visit [https://cla.microsoft.com](https://cla.microsoft.com). When you
submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment).
Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do
this once across all repositories using our CLA.

## Specifications subject to the Open Web Foundation Agreements

In addition, by making a contribution to specifications in this repository, you,
on behalf of yourself, your employer, and its affiliates, are making those
contributions subject to the obligations set forth in the [OWF Contributor
License Agreement 1.0 - Copyright and
Patent](http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owf-contributor-license-agreement-1-0---copyright-and-patent).

Final specifications developed in this repository will be subject to the [Open
Web Foundation Final Specification Agreement (“OWFa

OWFa 1.0 will be applied as follows:

- The maintainer will notify all contributors to a designated specification in
  writing via provided contact information of the start of a 30 day review
  period, after which the specification will be subject to the OWFa 1.0.

- During that 30 day period, contributors may provide written notice to the
  maintainer that the contributor is not making the forgoing commitment under
  OWFa 1.0 for the designated specification (“Exclusion”).

- Upon the end of that 30 day notice period, those contributors who have not
  issued an Exclusion, on behalf of themselves, their employer, and its
  affiliates, will, without further action, be subject to the obligations set
  forth in the OWFa 1.0 for the designated specification.
